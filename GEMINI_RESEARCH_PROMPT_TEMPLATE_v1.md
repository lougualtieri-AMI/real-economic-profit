## Gemini Deep Research Prompt Template

````
You are a senior equity research analyst. I need a comprehensive forward-looking research report on {{COMPANY_NAME}} ({{TICKER}}).

CONTEXT: I have completed a quantitative Real Economic Profit analysis using SEC filing data through {{LATEST_FILING_DATE}}. Below are the key findings. Your job is to bridge the gap from that date to today ({{TODAY_DATE}}) and provide the qualitative context the numbers alone cannot answer.

QUANTITATIVE BASELINE (from my analysis):
- Latest filing period: {{FISCAL_PERIOD}} ({{FILING_TYPE}})
- Real Economic Profit: {{REAL_PROFIT}} ({{CONSERVATIVE_OR_ASSET_LIGHT}} view)
- Cash From Operations: {{CFO}}
- Real ROIC: {{REAL_ROIC}}
- Revenue: {{REVENUE}}
- Real Cash Yield on EV: {{REAL_YIELD}}
- Real P/E: {{REAL_PE}}
- Total CapEx: {{TOTAL_CAPEX}}
- R&D Expense: {{RD_EXPENSE}}
- SBC Burden: {{SBC_AMOUNT}} ({{SBC_PCT_CFO}}% of CFO)
- Key risk flags from filing: {{RISK_FLAGS_SUMMARY}}

PROFIT MOMENTUM (observed from multi-year data):
- Real Profit trend: {{PROFIT_TREND_DESCRIPTION}}
- ROIC trend: {{ROIC_TREND_DESCRIPTION}}
- Revenue trend: {{REVENUE_TREND_DESCRIPTION}}
- Invested Capital trend: {{IC_TREND_DESCRIPTION}}

SECTION 1 — POST-FILING DEVELOPMENTS ({{LATEST_FILING_DATE}} to {{TODAY_DATE}})
Research and report any material developments since the last filing date:
- Subsequent quarterly earnings releases (revenue, EPS, CFO, guidance)
- New SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, proxy)
- Material litigation developments or settlements
- M&A activity (acquisitions, divestitures, announced deals)
- Management changes or strategic pivots
- Credit rating changes
- Dividend or buyback announcements
- Analyst consensus estimate changes

For each development, provide the date, the source, and the financial impact if quantifiable.

SECTION 2 — PROFIT MOMENTUM DRIVERS
My quantitative analysis shows the profit and ROIC trends described above, but cannot explain WHY. Please research and assess each of the following:

a) PRICING POWER: Is the company raising prices on core products? How are prices trending versus competitors and versus input cost inflation? Is there evidence of consumer pushback or trade-down?

b) VOLUME TRENDS: Is unit volume growing, flat, or declining? Are market share positions stable? Cite specific market share data if available (e.g., Nielsen, IRI, or company-reported).

c) EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY: Are there active restructuring or productivity programs? What are the targeted savings and where are they in execution? Is gross margin expanding from operational improvements?

d) BUSINESS MIX: Is the revenue mix shifting toward higher-margin or higher-growth segments? Are there segments outperforming or underperforming the consolidated average?

e) INVESTMENT CHANNELS: For this company, what are the primary channels of growth investment (CapEx, R&D, advertising, acquisitions, or some combination)? How much is the company spending through each channel, and is that spending accelerating or decelerating?

f) ONE-TIME FACTORS: Are any recent results flattered or suppressed by non-recurring items (impairments, legal settlements, tax benefits, restructuring charges, FX swings)?

SECTION 3 — RISK UPDATE
For each risk flag identified in my analysis, provide a current status update:
{{RISK_FLAGS_BULLETED_LIST}}

Additionally, identify any NEW material risks that have emerged since the filing date, including:
- Regulatory or legislative changes
- Competitive threats
- Macroeconomic shifts (tariffs, FX, inflation, interest rates)
- ESG or reputational issues
- Supply chain disruptions

SECTION 4 — FORWARD GUIDANCE AND CONSENSUS
- What guidance has management provided for the current and next fiscal year?
- What is the current Wall Street consensus for revenue, EPS, and FCF?
- Where does management's tone suggest confidence vs caution?
- Are there specific catalysts or headwinds on the near-term horizon (within 6-12 months)?

SECTION 5 — INVESTMENT ASSESSMENT
Based on your research, provide:
a) The single most important development since {{LATEST_FILING_DATE}} for an investment decision
b) Whether the quantitative trends (profit momentum, ROIC trajectory) are likely to continue, accelerate, or reverse — and why
c) The 2-3 factors that will most determine share price performance over the next 12 months
d) Any disconnect between what the numbers show and what the qualitative picture suggests

FORMAT: Structure your response clearly using the section numbers above. Cite specific sources with dates. Use actual numbers wherever possible — do not hedge with vague language when data is available. If information is unavailable or uncertain, say so explicitly rather than speculating.

## Example: What Claude Would Generate for Colgate-Palmolive FY2024 Audit

After completing the CL FY2024 audit, Claude would output:

---

**Copy the prompt below into Gemini Deep Research:**

```
You are a senior equity research analyst. I need a comprehensive forward-looking research report on Colgate-Palmolive Company (CL).

CONTEXT: I have completed a quantitative Real Economic Profit analysis using SEC filing data through December 31, 2024. Below are the key findings. Your job is to bridge the gap from that date to today (February 16, 2026) and provide the qualitative context the numbers alone cannot answer.

QUANTITATIVE BASELINE (from my analysis):
- Latest filing period: FY2024 (10-K filed Feb 13, 2025)
- Real Economic Profit: $3.3B (Asset-Light view)
- Cash From Operations: $4.107B
- Real ROIC: 48.1%
- Revenue: $20.1B
- Real Cash Yield on EV: 2.61%
- Real P/E: ~24x
- Total CapEx: $561M
- R&D Expense: $355M
- SBC Burden: $141M (3.4% of CFO)
- Key risk flags from filing: Talcum powder litigation (309 cases), ERISA litigation (potential cash contribution), Brazilian tax disputes (~$140M), US tariffs, hyperinflationary markets (Argentina, Türkiye, Nigeria)

PROFIT MOMENTUM (observed from multi-year data):
- Real Profit trend: Growing — $3.0B (FY2023) → $3.3B (FY2024), +11.5%
- ROIC trend: Rising — 37.3% (FY2023) → 48.1% (FY2024)
- Revenue trend: Growing — $19.5B → $20.1B, +3.3%
- Invested Capital trend: Declining — $8.0B → $6.9B (buyback-driven)

SECTION 1 — POST-FILING DEVELOPMENTS (December 31, 2024 to February 16, 2026)
Research and report any material developments since the last filing date:
- Subsequent quarterly earnings releases (revenue, EPS, CFO, guidance)
- New SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, proxy)
- Material litigation developments or settlements
- M&A activity (acquisitions, divestitures, announced deals)
- Management changes or strategic pivots
- Credit rating changes
- Dividend or buyback announcements
- Analyst consensus estimate changes

For each development, provide the date, the source, and the financial impact if quantifiable.

SECTION 2 — PROFIT MOMENTUM DRIVERS
My quantitative analysis shows profit growing 11.5% on 3.3% revenue growth while invested capital declined 13.8%, producing a dramatic ROIC expansion from 37% to 48%. The numbers cannot explain WHY. Please research and assess each of the following:

a) PRICING POWER: Is Colgate raising prices on core oral care, personal care, and pet nutrition products? How are prices trending versus competitors (P&G, Unilever, Church & Dwight) and versus input cost inflation? Is there evidence of consumer pushback or trade-down?

b) VOLUME TRENDS: Is unit volume growing, flat, or declining? Are market share positions stable? Cite specific market share data (Colgate reported 41.4% global toothpaste share in FY2024).

c) EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY: The 2022 Global Productivity Initiative incurred $85M in FY2024. Has it concluded? Are there successor programs? What savings were achieved? Is gross margin expansion coming from productivity or pricing?

d) BUSINESS MIX: Is Hill's Pet Nutrition growing faster than oral care? Is the skin health business (EltaMD, Filorga, PCA SKIN) contributing positively or dragging? Is the mix shift toward higher-margin segments?

e) INVESTMENT CHANNELS: Colgate spent $2.7B on advertising in FY2024 (up 15% YoY), $355M on R&D, and only $561M on CapEx. Is the advertising step-up translating to measurable market share gains? Is R&D producing visible innovation pipeline results?

f) ONE-TIME FACTORS: Are FY2024 results flattered or suppressed by non-recurring items? The $85M restructuring charge depressed profit — is that ending? Are there FX tailwinds or headwinds in subsequent periods?

SECTION 3 — RISK UPDATE
For each risk flag identified in my analysis, provide a current status update:
- Talcum powder litigation (309 cases pending as of FY2024)
- ERISA litigation (potential cash contribution following adverse judgment)
- Brazilian tax disputes (~$93M interest deductions + ~$47M Treasury bill assessments)
- US tariffs (Feb 2025 executive orders and subsequent developments)
- Hyperinflationary economies (Argentina, Türkiye, Nigeria)
- Geopolitical risks (Ukraine, Middle East)

Additionally, identify any NEW material risks that have emerged since December 31, 2024.

SECTION 4 — FORWARD GUIDANCE AND CONSENSUS
- What guidance has management provided for FY2025 and FY2026?
- What is the current Wall Street consensus for revenue, EPS, and FCF?
- Where does management's tone suggest confidence vs caution?
- Are there specific catalysts or headwinds on the near-term horizon?

SECTION 5 — INVESTMENT ASSESSMENT
Based on your research, provide:
a) The single most important development since December 31, 2024 for an investment decision
b) Whether the quantitative trends (profit momentum, ROIC trajectory) are likely to continue, accelerate, or reverse — and why
c) The 2-3 factors that will most determine share price performance over the next 12 months
d) Any disconnect between what the numbers show and what the qualitative picture suggests

FORMAT: Structure your response clearly using the section numbers above. Cite specific sources with dates. Use actual numbers wherever possible. If information is unavailable or uncertain, say so explicitly rather than speculating.

## Integration with the Audit Workflow

The updated workflow becomes:

1. **Gemini extracts** data from SEC filing → JSON + scratchpad
2. **Claude audits** (Parts 1–5) and verifies the extraction
3. **Claude auto-generates** a customized Gemini research prompt (this document) with all the company-specific numbers filled in
4. **User pastes** the prompt into Gemini Deep Research
5. **Gemini researches** and returns the qualitative report
6. **User pastes** the Gemini report back into the Claude conversation
7. **Claude completes Part 6** — now with both quantitative verification AND qualitative context to make a genuine assessment of profit momentum drivers, growth quality, and forward outlook

This ensures the Gemini research is always:
- Anchored to the specific quantitative findings (not generic)
- Focused on the time gap between the filing and today
- Structured to answer the questions the numbers can't answer
- Directly useful for Claude's Part 6 assessment
