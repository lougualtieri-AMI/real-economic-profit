## Core Metrics (Custom to This Framework)

**Real Economic Profit (REP)**
What a company actually earns in cash after accounting for true stock dilution, real asset maintenance, and one-time charges. Formula: CFO − Real SBC − Maintenance CapEx − Restructuring + Investment Income. This is the central metric of the framework.

**Real Cash Yield**
Real Economic Profit divided by Enterprise Value. Answers: "What is my real cash return on the market price?" A yield of 5% means the business generates $5 of real profit for every $100 of enterprise value. Higher is better. Below 2% = expensive.

**Real ROIC (Return on Invested Capital)**
Real Economic Profit divided by Invested Capital (Equity + Debt − Cash − STI). Measures how efficiently the company uses its deployed capital. Above 12% is strong; below 6% is concerning.

**Real ROIC — Conservative vs. Asset-Light Views**
The Conservative view uses full D&A × 1.05 as maintenance CapEx. The Asset-Light view uses only physical Depreciation × 1.05, excluding intangible amortization from acquisitions. For companies like Broadcom that grow through M&A, the asset-light view better reflects actual cash maintenance needs since acquired intangibles (customer relationships, technology) don't require equivalent cash spending to maintain.

**Real SBC (Stock-Based Compensation) Burden**
The greater of SBC Expense (from the cash flow statement) or SBC Grant Date Fair Value (RSUs granted × weighted-average grant price). The MAX function captures the true dilution cost to shareholders, since the accounting expense often understates the economic value being transferred to employees.

**Return on NTA (Net Tangible Assets)**
Real Economic Profit divided by Net Tangible Assets (Total Assets − Goodwill − Intangible Assets − Cash − STI). Strips out acquisition premiums and buyback-compressed equity to show what the operating assets actually earn. Useful for comparing companies with very different M&A and capital return histories.

**Real P/E**
Share Price divided by Real Economic Profit per share. An alternative to traditional P/E that uses real profit instead of reported earnings.

**Unlevered Yield**
(Real Economic Profit + Interest Paid) divided by Enterprise Value. Shows the yield as if the company had no debt — useful for comparing companies with different capital structures.

**Real vs. Reported Gap**
Real Economic Profit minus Reported Free Cash Flow (CFO − Total CapEx). A negative gap means reported FCF overstates real earnings, typically because SBC dilution is not deducted in traditional FCF.

## Capital & Growth Metrics

**Invested Capital (IC)**
Shareholders' Equity + Total Debt − Cash − Short-Term Investments. Represents the total capital deployed in the business from both equity holders and debt holders, net of liquid assets.

**Net Tangible Assets (NTA)**
Total Assets − Goodwill − Intangible Assets − Cash − STI. The physical and working capital assets actually deployed in operations, excluding acquisition-related paper assets and liquid holdings.

**Growth CapEx**
Total CapEx minus Maintenance CapEx. Capital spending beyond what's needed to maintain the current asset base — this is the investment in future growth.

**Maintenance CapEx — Conservative**
When not disclosed by the company, estimated as D&A × 1.05 (depreciation and amortization plus a 5% inflation buffer). Represents the annual cash spending needed to maintain the current productive capacity. The 1.05 multiplier accounts for the fact that replacing aging assets costs more today than when they were originally purchased.

**Maintenance CapEx — Asset-Light**
Physical Depreciation Only × 1.05 (excluding intangible amortization). For acquisition-heavy companies, most D&A is amortization of purchased intangibles (customer lists, technology, trade names) which don't require equivalent cash replacement. This view better reflects actual cash needs but is only available when depreciation is broken out separately.

**Reinvestment Rate**
Growth CapEx divided by Invested Capital. The fraction of capital being redeployed into growth.

**Implied Profit Growth**
Reinvestment Rate × Real ROIC. Estimates the organic profit growth rate assuming reinvested capital earns returns at the current ROIC.

**Incremental Return on Growth CapEx**
Year-over-year change in Real Profit divided by prior year's Growth CapEx. Shows what each dollar of growth spending actually produced in new earnings.

## Input Fields & Data Sources

**CFO (Cash From Operations)**
Net cash provided by operating activities, from the cash flow statement. The starting point for Real Economic Profit — represents actual cash generated by the business before capital spending.

**SBC Expense Addback**
Stock-based compensation expense added back in the operating activities section of the cash flow statement. This is a non-cash charge that increases reported CFO.

**SBC Grant Date Fair Value**
Calculated from the Stock-Based Compensation footnote: total units granted (RSUs, PSUs, options) × their weighted-average grant-date fair value. This represents the market value of stock awards at the time they were granted to employees.

**D&A (Depreciation & Amortization)**
Combined depreciation of physical assets and amortization of intangible assets. Found in the cash flow statement as an adjustment to net income. For the framework, D&A is the basis for estimating maintenance CapEx when not disclosed.

**Depreciation Only**
Physical depreciation of property, plant, and equipment — excluding amortization of intangible assets. Found in the cash flow statement adjustments (often broken out separately). Used for the Asset-Light maintenance CapEx view.

**Amortization**
D&A minus Depreciation. Represents the accounting charge for acquired intangible assets losing value on a schedule. For acquisitive companies, this can be many times larger than physical depreciation. Important: amortization is an accounting convention — acquired customer relationships and technology often retain or grow in value even as they amortize to zero on the books.

**Total CapEx (Capital Expenditures)**
Purchases of property, plant, and equipment from the investing activities section of the cash flow statement. Always entered as a positive number in the app.

**Restructuring Charges**
One-time (or recurring) charges for layoffs, facility closures, and reorganization. Deducted from Real Economic Profit. If a company restructures every year, it's effectively an ongoing operating cost.

**Inventory Change**
From the cash flow statement. Positive = inventory decreased (cash freed). Negative = inventory increased (cash trapped in unsold goods).

**Receivables Change**
From the cash flow statement. Positive = receivables decreased (cash collected from customers). Negative = receivables increased (revenue recorded but cash not yet received).

**Interest Paid**
Cash interest paid, from supplemental disclosures at the bottom of the cash flow statement. Used for unlevered yield calculation and leverage analysis.

**Income Tax Paid**
Cash taxes paid, from supplemental disclosures. Often dramatically different from the tax provision on the income statement due to deferred taxes, credits, and timing differences.

**STI (Short-Term Investments)**
Current marketable securities on the balance sheet. Treated like cash in the framework — liquid assets not deployed in the business, so subtracted from Invested Capital.

**EV (Enterprise Value)**
Market Cap + Total Debt − Cash − STI. Represents the total price to acquire the entire business, including taking on its debt and receiving its cash.

## Growth Decomposition (Multi-Year Analysis)

**Organic Growth**
Profit growth from the existing business getting more productive — pricing power, margin expansion, customer growth, efficiency gains. Does not require additional capital deployment.

**Reinvestment Growth**
Profit growth attributable to growth CapEx earning returns. Estimated as prior year's Growth CapEx × prior year's ROIC (assumes ~1 year lag for investments to produce returns).

**Profit CAGR**
Compound Annual Growth Rate of Real Economic Profit across the analysis period.

**Capital CAGR**
Compound Annual Growth Rate of Invested Capital. If Capital CAGR exceeds Profit CAGR, the company is deploying more capital but not proportionally growing profits — returns are diluting.

**Profit / Capital Growth Ratio**
Profit CAGR divided by Capital CAGR. Above 1.0x means profit is growing faster than capital — the business is becoming more efficient. Below 1.0x means capital is growing faster — incremental returns may be declining.

**Profit Composition**
Shows how much of each year's Real Economic Profit comes from the original organic base vs. cumulative returns from growth investments. Helps visualize whether growth spending is actually contributing to the bottom line.

## R&D Intensity (New in v3.0)

**R&D Expense**
Total research and development spending from the income statement. Under US GAAP, R&D is expensed immediately — it flows through the income statement and is already deducted from Cash From Operations. This means R&D is a real cash cost that's invisible to the CapEx-based growth framework.

**R&D / Revenue**
R&D Expense divided by Revenue. Shows what percentage of revenue is reinvested in research. Typical ranges: 15–25% for semiconductor companies, 10–20% for software, 5–15% for diversified tech, near 0% for financial or service companies.

**R&D / CapEx Ratio**
R&D Expense divided by Total CapEx. When this exceeds 3x, R&D is the dominant investment channel — the company invests primarily through the income statement, not the balance sheet. Growth Decomposition understates actual reinvestment for these companies because it only sees CapEx.

**R&D / CFO**
R&D Expense divided by Cash From Operations. Shows what fraction of cash generation is consumed by R&D. High ratios (above 50%) mean the company is plowing most of its cash back into research.

**Total Reinvestment (CapEx + R&D)**
The full picture of how much a company reinvests in its future. For traditional manufacturers, CapEx dominates. For technology companies, R&D can be 5–20x larger than CapEx. Comparing only CapEx across these company types is misleading.

**R&D-Dominant Investment Model**
Flagged when R&D exceeds 3x CapEx. Indicates the Growth Decomposition's "Base Erosion" signal may be misleading — the company is investing heavily in growth through a channel the CapEx-based framework can't see. The Asset-Light view typically better reflects economics for these companies.

**Acquisition Amortization Distortion**
When a company shows negative organic growth in the Growth Decomposition but has massive R&D spending (>3x CapEx), the "Base Erosion" diagnosis is replaced with this more accurate label. The distortion occurs because acquired intangible amortization inflates the Conservative maintenance CapEx estimate while R&D-driven growth is invisible to the framework.

## Red Flags & Signals

**Hidden SBC Dilution**
Flagged when SBC Grant Value exceeds SBC Expense by more than 20%. Indicates the accounting expense understates the true value being transferred to employees, often because grants were made at higher stock prices than the historical grants being amortized.

**SBC as % of CFO**
Real SBC divided by Cash From Operations. Above 30% is a warning — shareholders are funding a large portion of employee compensation through dilution. Above 15% is worth monitoring.

**Off-Balance-Sheet / Risk Flags**
Extracted from SEC filing footnotes by Gemini. Covers: SPVs (Special Purpose Vehicles), VIEs (Variable Interest Entities), contingent liabilities, material contractual commitments, related-party transactions, and other items not captured in the financial statements.

## Data Pipeline

**SEC 10-K**: Annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Contains full-year financial statements, footnotes, and management discussion. Primary source for all cash flow items.

**SEC 10-Q**: Quarterly report. Used to update balance sheet items with more current data than the annual filing.

**Gemini Extraction**: Google Gemini processes the full 10-K/10-Q PDF and extracts structured JSON data using a standardized prompt (v3.1). The prompt uses Chain of Thought prompting — Gemini first produces an Analyst Scratchpad showing its work (sources, math, reasoning), then outputs the final 27-field JSON. One prompt, one response, no follow-up needed.

**Claude Audit**: The complete Gemini response (scratchpad + JSON) is pasted into a Claude conversation along with the original filing PDF. Claude cross-checks every number against the source document, verifies the scratchpad reasoning, and produces a corrected JSON if needed. One company per conversation for searchability.
